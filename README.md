# DNA Origami Nanorobots for Targeted Cancer Therapy: Data Extraction and Visualization

This project presents a data-driven exploration of a groundbreaking study from *Nature Nanotechnology* (2023), which describes the use of DNA origami nanostructures for delivering cancer-fighting peptides directly to tumor cells. The study introduces a pH-responsive nanorobot that activates only in acidic tumor environments, enabling highly selective therapy with fewer side effects.

## 🔍 Project Overview

I recreated and visualized experimental results from the publication using open-source tools. The original data was presented in images of scientific graphs, so I manually extracted the values using [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WPD/). I also included the original figure images in my Jupyter Notebook to support visual analysis and interpretation.
